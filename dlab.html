                  Conducted research under PhD students and professors to
                  understand scaffolding comprehension of unconventional visual systems.
                  Independently ran experimental and observational studies and used interviews,
                   ethnography transcription, and behavior data analysis to conclude results.
                   Used eye-tracking and mouse-clicking software to gain a better understanding
                   of the effectiveness between a user and system’s design.

                        <p>
                          As powerful as graphics may be in their communicative efficiency,
                          they needn’t be immediately easy to understand. In fact, there are often
                           real tradeoffs between a representation’s discoverability and efficiency.
                  Information Visualization involves developing sophisticated information interfaces for highly
                     skilled workers performing complex and specialized tasks.
                     Sometimes this work results in novel, unconventional representations
                     that are computationally suited to a particular set of data and analytical task,
                      but that present a graph-reading challenge to the reader.
               In this project, we use
               a simple but unconventional graph - The Triangular Model (TM) of Interval Relations (Qiang et. al. 2014)
         to explore how individuals make use of prior knowledge when reading unconventional graphs.
<br>
  In Study 1 we observe learners solving problems with the TM graph, and challenge them to design instructional aids.
  In Study 2 we design four scaffolding techniques and test their efficacy with both LM and TM graphs.
  In Study 3 we compare the effectiveness of explicit and implicit (impasse) scaffolds for the TM graph.

          <br>    Study 1 	     </h2>
             <p>In this exploratory study we observed students solving problems
               with a novel graph. After learning how the graph works,
               we challenged students to design instructional aids to make the graph
                “easier to read”. From these data we generate hypotheses for
                how we might scaffold comprehension for novel representations.

        <br>    Study 2	     </h2>
           <p>In Study Two we examine if scaffolding is effective in aiding untrained
              students to understand the Triangular Model graph. We know that
              students are unlikely to construct the correct interpretation
               of the TM without assistance. Guided by the results of the Study One Design Task,
               we created four scaffolds. We test the effectiveness of these scaffolds by
                seeking to replicate the Qiang et.al (2014) finding that after 20 minutes of
                video training, students perform faster and more accurately with the unconventional
                 TM than the conventional Linear Model (LM). Will our participants show similar
                 performance on the TM with scaffolds rather than formal instruction? Further,
                  will engagement with the TM in a reading task be sufficient for students to
                  reproduce the graph in a subsequent drawing task?

                      The purpose of the third experiment was to see if
                      presenting a graph-reading problem as a mental impasse
                      would improve comprehension. A mental impasse is
                      “a mental state in which problem-solving has come
                      to a halt; all possibilities have been exhausted and
                      the problem-solver cannot think of any way to proceed”

                    <p>
                      Our two-part procedure included
          60 SONA participants in 2 conditions. They were asked to complete a short introduction followed by
          15 questions using the graph.
          In the first 5 questions, they saw the graph with a condition,
          the last 10 questions were the same for every student.
          We measured score, response time, and tracked all of the mouse movements

<p>
  This visualization shows the type of answer given by each participant in the two groups.
  Green squares are correct (triangular) answers, and red are the incorrect cartesian answers.

  However, we noticed many yellow squares. These are answers that don’t make sense to us.
   At first we thought that these folks were not motivated or not trying hard enough, but we need to test this to
   find out. We ran a follow up study to observe students in more detail.

      </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3 animate-box fadeInUp animated-fast">
                   <h4 class="minititles"><br> Results</h4>
<p>
  We expected that students in the impasse condition would score significantly higher, and that is what we found.

On average, participants in the impasse group had higher scores. It was a statistically significant difference ,
with a moderate effect size.

However, we still found large individual differences, and many users gave answers that didn’t make sense to us.
The fact that the range of the green is so large means that there is many of individual differences.
